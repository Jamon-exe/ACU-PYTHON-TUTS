# Lists

---

An object that can store multiple items \*

> [!NOTE]
> Each items in s a list is called an **element**

---

Lists are defined with square brackets. For example

```{
    [1, 2, 3, 4] - list of integers
}
```

## List Indexing

The indexing position of items in a list starts at 0. For example, in the following list

```{
    ["carrot","cucumber" ,"onion", "apple", 2]}
```

The indexing position of the list going from _left to right_ would ----> start from 0
The indexing position of the list going from _right to left_ would ----> start from 0

> [!NOTE] > **mutability**- lists are mutable.\*For example `a[2]` will print `onion`

## List Slicing

a[start : end]
a[start: ] --> items from
a[ :end]--> end at

a[1 : 3] when a = ["carrot", 'cucumber', 'onion', 'apple', 2]

print( a =[ 1 : 3 ]) will return ['cucumber', 'onion']

#### Steps

> [!NOTE]
> when a[1 : 2 : 3] , 1 is the start index, 2 is the end index, 3 are the steps
