Lists are defined with square brackets. For example

```{
    [1, 2, 3, 4] - list of integers
}
```

## List Indexing

The indexing position of items in a list starts at 0. For example, in the following list

```{
    ["carrot","cucumber" ,"onion", "apple", 2]
}
```

The indexing position of the list going from _left to right_ would ----> start from 0
The indexing position of the list going from _right to left_ would ----> start from 0

> [!NOTE] > **mutability**- lists are mutable.\*For example `a[2]` will print `onion`
